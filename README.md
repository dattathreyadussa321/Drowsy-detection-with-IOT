# 💤 Drowsiness Detection System using IoT (Python + Arduino)

A real-time drowsiness detection system that uses a laptop’s built-in camera to analyze eye aspect ratio (EAR) and alerts the user through a buzzer connected to an Arduino board. This project is ideal for applications in **driver safety**, **machine operation**, and **focus monitoring**.
